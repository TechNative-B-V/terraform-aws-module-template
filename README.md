# terraform-aws-module-template

Template for creating a new TerraForm AWS Module. For TechNative Engineers.

## Instructions

### Your Module Name

Think hard and come up with the shortest descriptive name for your module.
Look at competition in the [terraform
registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).

Your module name should be max. three words seperated by dashes. E.g.

- html-form-action
- new-account-notifier
- budget-alarms
- fix-missing-tags

### Setup Github Project

1. Click the template button on the top right...
2. Name github project `terraform-aws-[your-module-name]`
3. Make project private untill ready for publication
2. Install `pre-commit`

### Develop your module

1. Develop your module
2. Try to use the [best practices for TerraForm
   development](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/) and [TerraForm AWS
   Development](https://github.com/ozbillwang/terraform-best-practices).

## Finish project documentation

1. Set well written title
2. Add one or more shields
3. Start readme with a short and complete as possible module description. This
   is the part where you sell your module.
4. Complete README with well written documentation. Try to think as a someone
   with three months of Terraform experience.
5. Check if pre-commit correctly generates the standard Terraform documentation.

## Publish module

If your module is in a state that it could be useful for others and ready for
publication, you can publish a first version.

1. Create a [Github
   Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
2. Publish in the TerraForm Registry under the Technative Namespace (the GitHub
   Repo must be in the TechNative Organization)
